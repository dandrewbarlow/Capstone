# Emitting CU Website

## Description

Site to promote the super cool CU Boulder Capstone project Emitting!

## Site Information

Made with a fairly minimal tech stack. Really the only special sauce is using SASS over CSS, largely due to personal preference. Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for visual effects, but this library and all javascript are referenced the old fashioned way.

### Quick Setup

Pretty easy to get sass working, but I have an npm script to watch my main sass file and transpile to css, so after cloning this repo, all you really need to run is:

```
npm i --save-dev sass
npm run watch
```
